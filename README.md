# SorterBot Labeltool

This repoistory contains two tools. One is a video player, which opens a video recorded by the Pi Camera, and allows the user to draw bounding boxes to it. After fine-tuning the parameters using the sliders at the bottom of the screens, the bounding box positions are automatically calculated for the rest of the frames in the whole video.

The second tool enables to user to verify every picture created by the first tool, and discard the ones that are blurry or the bounding boxes are not correctly placed.

### Usage
Instructions coming soon.
